## How simple is it to use?
* Select the folder where you photos are
* Select another folder where you would like to copy them
* Click copy and it's done

It's that simple!



## For who do I recommend this program?
Mostly for photogarphers or for those who like to organise their photos by date, just like me. This was the main reason for creating this program.

## Basic features for users:
* Shows how many files are in the first folder
* Shows how many photos/videos the program copied&renamed


## Extra feature for developers
In the copied files folder there is a LOG file in TXT format.
The TXT contains a lot of information about the copy process

* From where did the user copy
* To where did the user copy
* Was it successful
* File names before/after
* How many files were copied
* How much time did it take
