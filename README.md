## How simple is it to use?




## For who do I recommend this program?
Mostly for photogarphers or for those who like to organise their photos by date, just like me. This was the main reason for creating this program.

## Basic features for users:
* 

## Extra feature for developers



A program that copies photos to a user-specified folder than renames depends on when they were taken.

Fully made by me, open source and almost bug free.
